# Language Basics

## Variables

&nbsp; int &nbsp;&nbsp; The int data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer                      <br>
&nbsp; float &nbsp;&nbsp; The float data type is a double-precision 64-vit IEEE 754 floating point  <br>
&nbsp; boolean &nbsp;&nbsp; The boolean data type has two possible values: true and false           <br>

## Operators

### Simple Assignment Operator

&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp; Simple Assignment operator  <br>

### Arithmetic Operators

&nbsp; + &nbsp;&nbsp; Additive operator       <br>
&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; Subtraction operator    <br>
&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; Multiplication operator <br>
&nbsp; / &nbsp;&nbsp; Division operator       <br>
&nbsp; ^ &nbsp;&nbsp; Power operator          <br>

### Unary Operators

&nbsp; + &nbsp;&nbsp; Unary plus operator; indicates positive values  <br>
&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; Unary minus operator; negates an expression     <br>

### Equality and Relational Operators

&nbsp; == &nbsp;&nbsp; Equal to                    <br>
&nbsp;  != &nbsp;&nbsp; Not equal to                <br>
&nbsp;  >   &nbsp;&nbsp; Greater than                <br>
&nbsp;  >= &nbsp;&nbsp; Greater than or equal to    <br>
&nbsp;  <   &nbsp;&nbsp; Less than                   <br>
&nbsp;  <= &nbsp;&nbsp; Less than or equal to       <br>

### Conditional Operators

&nbsp; && &nbsp;&nbsp; Conditional-AND     <br>
&nbsp; || &nbsp;&nbsp; Conditional-OR      <br>

## Control Flow Statements

### The if-then Statement

The if-then statement is a basic control flow statement that tells your programm to execute a certain section of code
only if a particular expression evaluates to true. <br>
Example:

```
if(<condition>):
    <statements>
end:
```

### The while Statement

The while statement continually executes a block of statements while a particular condition is true.

```
while(<condition>):
    <statements>
end:
```
